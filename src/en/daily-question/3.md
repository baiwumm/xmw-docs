title: Question 3：What is anti-shake and throttle? What's the difference? How to achieve it?

# {{ $frontmatter.title }}
::: tip debounce：
The function is executed only once within n seconds after the high-frequency event is triggered. If the high-frequency event is triggered again within n seconds, the time is recalculated
:::

1. For example: in Baidu search, after each input there are associative words pop up, this method of controlling associative words can not be triggered by a change in the content of the input box, he must be triggered when you end the input for a period of time.
> Each time an event is triggered, the previous delayed call method is canceled
```js
function debounce(fn) {
  let timeout = null;
  return function () {
    clearTimeout(timeout); 
    timeout = setTimeout(() => { 
      fn.apply(this, arguments);
    }, 500);
  };
}
function sayHi() {
  console.log('Anti-shake success');
}

var inp = document.getElementById('inp');
inp.addEventListener('input', debounce(sayHi));
```

::: tip throttle：
High-frequency events are triggered, but only execute once in n seconds, so throttling dilutes the execution frequency of the function
:::

2. For example, a function is scheduled to be executed only when it is greater than or equal to the execution period, and calls within the period are not executed. Just like when you snap up a limited number of hot selling goods on Taobao, you keep refreshing the point to buy, but there is always a period of time when you point is not effective, here is the use of throttle, is afraid of the point too fast to cause bugs in the system.
> High-frequency events are triggered, but only execute once in n seconds, so throttling dilutes the execution frequency of the function
```js
function throttle(fn) {
  let canRun = true; 
  return function () {
    if (!canRun) return; 
    canRun = false; // 
    setTimeout(() => { 
      fn.apply(this, arguments);
      canRun = true;
    }, 500);
  };
}
function sayHi(e) {
  console.log(e.target.innerWidth, e.target.innerHeight);
}
window.addEventListener('resize', throttle(sayHi));
```

3. Difference: debounce is to turn multiple executions into the last execution, and throttling is to turn multiple executions into execution at intervals.
