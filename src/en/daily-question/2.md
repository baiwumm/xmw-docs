# Question 2：['1', '2', '3'].map(parseInt) what & why ?

::: tip Reference answer：
[1, NaN, NaN]
:::
1. When parseInt('1', 0) //radix is 0, and the string parameter does not start with "0x" and "0", the radix is processed as base 10. This time returns 1
2. parseInt('2', 1) // For a number represented by base 1 (base 1), the maximum value is less than 2, so it cannot be parsed, return NaN
3. parseInt('3', 2) // A number represented by base 2 (base 2) whose maximum value is less than 3 cannot be parsed, and NaN is returned
