We understand this problem from the history of DOM nodes

```html
<div class="parent">
  <div class="child-1">
    <div class="child-1-1">
      <div class="child-1-1-1">a</div>
    </div>
    <div class="child-1-2">
      <div class="child-1-2-1">b</div>
    </div>
    <div class="child-1-3">c</div>
  </div>
  <div class="child-2">
    <div class="child-2-1">d</div>
    <div class="child-2-2">e</div>
  </div>
  <div class="child-3">
    <div class="child-3-1">f</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

The DOM tree is searched using depth-first traversal and breadth-first traversal

## Depth first traversal

Depth-first traversal DFS is similar to first-order traversal of trees.
Assuming that the initial state is that all vertices in the graph are not visited, starting from a certain vertex v, the vertex is first visited, and then starting from its unvisited adjacent points in turn, depth-first search traverses the graph until all vertices in the graph that have paths with v are visited. If there are still other vertices that are not accessed at this time, select another unaccessed vertex as the starting point, and repeat the process until all vertices in the graph have been accessed.

```js
let deepTraversal1 = (node, nodeList = []) => {
  if (node !== null) {
    nodeList.push(node);
    let children = node.children;
    for (let i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
      deepTraversal1(children[i], nodeList);
    }
  }
  return nodeList;
};
let deepTraversal2 = (node) => {
  let nodes = [];
  if (node !== null) {
    nodes.push(node);
    let children = node.children;
    for (let i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
      nodes = nodes.concat(deepTraversal2(children[i]));
    }
  }
  return nodes;
};
let deepTraversal3 = (node) => {
  let stack = [];
  let nodes = [];
  if (node) {
    stack.push(node);
    while (stack.length) {
      let item = stack.pop();
      let children = item.children;
      nodes.push(item);
      // node = [] stack = [parent]
      // node = [parent] stack = [child3,child2,child1]
      // node = [parent, child1] stack = [child3,child2,child1-2,child1-1]
      // node = [parent, child1-1] stack = [child3,child2,child1-2]
      for (let i = children.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        stack.push(children[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return nodes;
};
```

## Breadth-first traversal

Breadth-first traversal of BFS
Starting from a vertex v in the graph, after visiting v, each of v's unvisited adjacencies is visited successively, and then their adjacencies are visited successively from these adjacencies respectively, and the adjacencies of the first visited vertex are visited before the adjacencies of the later visited vertex are visited, until the adjacencies of all the vertices that have been visited in the graph are visited. If there are still vertices in the graph that have not been visited at this time, you need to select another vertex that has not been visited as a new starting point, and repeat the process until all vertices in the graph have been visited.

```js
let widthTraversal2 = (node) => {
  let nodes = [];
  let stack = [];
  if (node) {
    stack.push(node);
    while (stack.length) {
      let item = stack.shift();
      let children = item.children;
      nodes.push(item);
      // nodes = [] stack = [parent]
      // nodes = [parent] stack = [child1,child2,child3]
      // nodes = [parent, child1] stack = [child2,child3,child1-1,child1-2]
      // nodes = [parent,child1,child2]
      for (let i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
        stack.push(children[i]);
      }
    }
  }
  return nodes;
};
```

## Sum up

1. Depth-first traversal is a kind of algorithm that does not hit the south wall and does not head, and he will go back to the node with fork after the completion of a road
2. In breadth-first search, it starts from the starting point and expands "layer by layer", adding each point to the queue as it is discovered until the entire graph has been traversed
