1. `key` is the unique `id` of each `vnode` (virtual node), which can be relied on `key` to get the corresponding `vnode` node in `oldVnode` more accurately and faster.
2. More accurate because with `key` is not in situ multiplexing, in the `sameNode` function `a.key` === `b.key` comparison can avoid in situ multiplexing, so it will be more accurate.
3. Faster use of the uniqueness of `key` to generate `map` objects to obtain the corresponding node, faster than the traversal method.
