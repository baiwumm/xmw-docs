## setTimeout

```js
console.log("script start"); //1. print script start
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("settimeout"); // 4. print settimeout
}); // 2. Call the setTimeout function and define a callback function to execute when it completes
console.log("script end"); //3. print script end
// Output sequence：script start->script end->settimeout
```

## Promise

`Promise` itself is a synchronous immediate execution function, when `resolve` or `reject` is executed in `executor`, this is an asynchronous operation, and `then/catch` etc. is executed first, when the main stack is complete, The method stored in resolve/reject is called, and when p is printed, it returns the printed result, an instance of Promise.

```js
console.log("script start");
let promise1 = new Promise(function (resolve) {
  console.log("promise1");
  resolve();
  console.log("promise1 end");
}).then(function () {
  console.log("promise2");
});
setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("settimeout");
});
console.log("script end");
// Output sequence: script start->promise1->promise1 end->script end->promise2->settimeout
```

When the `JS` main thread executes to a `Promise` object:

- The callback of promise1.then() is a task
  - promise1 is resolved or rejected: the task is placed in the microtask queue of the current event cycle
  - promise1 is pending: the task is placed in a microtask queue at some future (possibly next) turn in the event loop
- The setTimeout callback is also a task and will be placed in the macrotask queue even if it is 0ms

Back to the classic example at the beginning of the article:

```js
const p = Promise.resolve(); // 1. The state of p is resolve；
(async () => {
  await p; // 2. Returns and puts the statement console.log('await end') after the function body into the microtask queue of the next event loop
  console.log("await end"); // 6. Execute, print await end
})();
p.then(() => {
  // 3. The state of p is resolve,P.hen () is placed in the microtask queue of the current event loop.
  console.log("then 1"); // 4. Do, print then 1
}).then(() => {
  console.log("then 2"); // 5. Run, print then 2, the current microtask queue ends, and run the next microtask queue
});
// Output result：then 1->then 1->await end
```

For example:

```js
console.log("script start");

setTimeout(function () {
  console.log("setTimeout");
}, 0);

Promise.resolve()
  .then(function () {
    console.log("promise1");
  })
  .then(function () {
    console.log("promise2");
  });

console.log("script end");
// Output result：script start->script end->promise1->promise2->setTimeout
```

## async await

```js
async function async1() {
  console.log("async1 start");
  await async2();
  console.log("async1 end");
}
async function async2() {
  console.log("async2");
}

console.log("script start");
async1();
console.log("script end");

// Output sequence：script start->async1 start->async2->script end->async1 end
```

The `async` function returns a Promise object, and when the function is executed it returns an `await` as soon as it encounters an `await`, waiting until the triggered asynchronous operation is complete before executing further statements in the function body. Can be understood as, is to give up the thread, out of the `async` function body.

For example:

```js
async function func1() {
  return 1;
}

console.log(func1());
```

It is obvious that the result of func1 is actually a Promise object. So we can also use `then` to handle subsequent logic.

```js
func1().then((res) => {
  console.log(res); // 1
});
```

The meaning of `await` is to wait, that is, the `async` function needs to wait for the completion of the function after `await` and have the return result (`Promise` object) before continuing to execute the following code. `await` implements the effect of synchronization by returning a Promise object.
